The projects uses visual studio 2015 and C++11 standard. Please

use VS2015 to open the project in projects folder and run the project. 

The logs,projects and source_code folder have two versions projects. 

One is the professor required as original version. The other is make 

the bus distance uniform version called optimization version. 



This HomeWork contians 6 folders:

graphics: the observe figures and code key part snapshot, the figures are generated

          by matlab 

logs: record the system log

projects: store the entire VS projects

report: store the report file (one docx , one pdf, same content, diferent version)

source code: store the system header file and souce file.

matlab_code: to plot the bus location and show difference between optimization version and original version


Thanks!
